# ConstraintProgramming
Declarative language approach for constraint programming

Constraint Programming can be regarded as the programming paradigm that aims at

"Computer finds the answer satisfying constraints when giving a problem as an aggregate of constraints to computer."

It is important to distinguish the description of constraint problem from the procedure and the way to solve a problem. Describing a problem with constraint has the "declarative" character. The important feature of constraint is "the processing direction is not fixed." We can consider that this feature is the character of complete "declaration". 
On the other hand, there may be various ways to solve problems. But on Constraint Programming in a narrow sense, the target for researches is the technique to efficiently find answers by well using the constraints in the problem. The program to find the solution satisfying constraints is called Constraint Solution System or Constraint Solver. The actual algorithm for Constraint Solution depends on the kind of constraint (what type of constraint against what type of variable).
